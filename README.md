# MOROP [MObile-RObot-Platform]
The MOROP run with ROS at its core, This repo holds the source code developed for an android application which would interface with
the robot and subscribe to certain topics in order to draw a map of its surrounding using on-board sensors and display it on the 
application.
On top of that a joy-stick is also available on the map which helps navigat the robote directly from the application.
This makes the application useful for both getting the lay of the land by navigating the robot around an unknown place and getting 
a map, or to navigate the robot in a known map. 
This feature could be very useful in navigating a hazardous environment or any area where supervised remote control of the robot is needed.
